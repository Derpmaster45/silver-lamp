 Bat has appeared!

 2) Magic/Special  
 3) Block

DEBUG: ENEMY HAS  130 of 100
You take a swing at the enemy
 dealing -30
This is being worked on at the moment. 
The Bat has no special attack points, so it does not attack.

Would you like to 
1) Attack 
 2) Magic/Special  
 3) Block
 for some reason (Bad math ) the bat is actually not taking damage when attacked.
 - fix
  - I ended up taking damageDealt and multiplying it by -1, and then subtracting that from the enemies current health points.
  
  - issue #2 When you use magic attacks the players turn does not end.
  - fix Set the magicattackchoice variable to what ever input the player enters. This is caused by the way I originally designed the magic system. I forgot about the magicattackchoice variable entirely until i was scrolling through the code
  trying to find the cause of the issue. I originally thought it was the battlesystem choice not being reset. So I created debug statements (using debug tools in a console application is hard to do to an extent) printing them to the console to see what was being passed through to the variables.
